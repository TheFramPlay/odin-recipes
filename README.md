First project to make a website!
I think this project is going to have me create a list of things I will need to make something. Let's see how this goes.

Okay so far, I've created a link to a recipe page that has an image on it underneath a heading.

I now have a list of recipes on the index page that I can click to go to whichever recipe that I want. I even added a link to go back to the index page at the bottom of the recipe pages.

I have now successfully pushed my project to Github. This was a great experience on building a basic recipe website!
